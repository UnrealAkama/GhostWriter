GhostWriter is a static python website generator. It uses [jinja2][1] for templating and uses [Markdown][2] to generate the content. The concept was born out of Show HN post that exhibited software much like this one. There is nothing special or amazing about this software, it's just something I wanted to write for myself, to better understand HTML and CSS.
