### About Me

I am a computer science student at a midwest university. My primary interests are artificial intelligence and computer security.

My work in artificial intelligence covers natural language processing, machine learning for data science, computer vision, and artificial intelligence applied to games. Current projects include of building a natural language processing system for general commands with only training for the system as a whole. The goal is to be able to recognise and process new commands with no training. Another effort of mine is to build an agent for wumpus world using neural network and no hand programmed rules.

In the area of computer security, areas of interest include hash cracking, social engineering, bypassing network controls, and next generation botnets. I have written a distributed hash cracker and am working on improving it. Another effort is developing a next generation botnet and developing strategies for advanced botnets take down.
